        <h3 class="centerAlign">Why I wanted to join CodeNation</h3>
            <p>I was made redundant during the Covid-19 lockdowns, and I wanted to make a start into a new, more stable career. CodeNation provided me with the opportunity to learn a new trade that I was already interested in anyway, and had been recommended to look into by my eldest brother. I'm very excited about the opportunities that CodeNation can provide me and the prospect of stability and security in my future.</p>
        <h3 class="centerAlign">Week One Targets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the fundamentals of JavaScripts</li>
            <li>Pushing work to GitHub</li>
            <li>Developing research skills</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>I feel that I have taken big steps into understanding the logic and syntax of JavaScript, however I believe that I still have a few topics such as Objects and Loops that I still have to understand more thoroughly</p>
        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker = "true">GitHub still confuses me. I have had some technical issues with it working through the terminal and I would appreciate running over it again with a tutor from the ground up, as I think after a week of learning JavaScript it was a lot to throw on at the end</p>
        <p>I definitely benifited from being on the develop course, as I feel that my researching skills have only grown stronger from then, especially having a headstart on how to start searching for answers and the correct terms to search for</p>
