            <p>One of my biggest hobbies is cosplaying. I have been building props and replicas ever since I was 10 years old, and I have learned so many different methods and techniques to apply. From starting at building swords out of spare planks of wood, to building suits of armour out of EVA foam, and most recently acquiring a 3D printer and teaching myself to 3D model, I adore learning about new ways to recreate some of my favourite items from TV shows and Movies.</p>
            <p>Particularly, I enjoy the problem solving nature of making these items. Every new technique I learn is a new implement in my toolbox, and it gives me so many new options to take the things I can imagine in my head and actually make them a physical reality.</p>

        <div id="modellingText" class="centerAlign">
            <p>I did one year of University back in 2016 on a game design course. I dropped out at the end of the year as I was uncertain whether it was for me, but the one thing I was certain of was that I really enjoyed learning to 3D model.</p>
            <p>I casually kept up with 3D modelling, doing it for fun in my own time, but in 2020 when I acquired my own 3D printer to keep myself occupied over lockdown, I decided to more actively learn new 3D modelling methods. I'm familiar with programs such as 3DS Max, Blender and online tools such as TinkerCAD.</p>

        <div id="codingText" class="centerAlign">
            <p>I decided to take up coding towards the end of 2020 as I was looking to get into a new career. I had studied Game Design at university for a year but had never focused on the systems that actually made games work. It has been an exciting time to actually be learning something new again after all this time, and I really enjoy the puzzle solving nature that coding and development brings with it, as well as the creative itch that is scratched by creating my own websites and even developing my own text adventure games!</p>
            <p>In the few months that I have been learning to code, I have learned Python and JavaScript, while having more of a fondness for HTML and CSS. With these combined I believe I have the makings of a skilled full-stack developer in the future, but I definitely know that I'll always have a fondness for front end development as it lets me flex my designing skills.</p>
